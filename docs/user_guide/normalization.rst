.. _usage_normalization:

Data normalization options
==========================

The microarray expression data provided by the AHBA has been subjected to some
`normalization procedures <help.brain-map.org/display/humanbrain/
Documentation>`_ designed to mitigate potential differences in expression
values between donors due to "batch effects." Despite these procedures, there
are still some notable differences between donors present in the downloadable
data.

By default, :func:`abagen.get_expression_data` aggregates expression data
across donors (though this can be prevented via the ``return_donors``
parameter). Prior to aggregation, the function performs a within-donor
normalization procedure to attempt to mitigate donor-specific effects; however,
there are a number of ways to achieve this.

Currently, ``abagen`` supports nine options for normalizing data:

    1. :ref:`usage_norm_center`,
    2. :ref:`usage_norm_zscore`,
    3. :ref:`usage_norm_minmax`,
    4. :ref:`usage_norm_sig`,
    5. :ref:`usage_norm_scaledsig`,
    6. :ref:`usage_norm_scaledsig_qnt`,
    7. :ref:`usage_norm_rs`,
    8. :ref:`usage_norm_srs`, and
    9. :ref:`usage_norm_mixedsig`

Most of the options have been used at various points throughout the published
record, so while there is no "right" choice we do encourage using the default
option (:ref:`scaled robust sigmoid <usage_norm_srs>`) due to recent work by
Arnatkevičiūte et al., 2019 showing that it is---as the name might
suggest---robust to outlier effects commonly observed in microarray data.

We describe all the methods in detail here; these can be implemented by passing
the ``sample_norm`` and ``gene_norm`` keyword arguments to
:func:`abagen.get_expression_data`. For a selection of references to published
works that have used these different methods please see the documentation of
:func:`abagen.normalize_expression`.

.. _usage_norm_sampledonor:

``sample_norm`` vs ``gene_norm``
--------------------------------

Microarray expression data can be normalized in two directions:

    1. Each sample can be normalized across all genes, or
    2. Each gene can be normalized across all samples

These different forms of normalization are controlled by two parameters in the
:func:`abagen.get_expression_data` function: ``sample_norm`` and ``gene_norm``.
Note that normalization of each sample across all genes occurs before
normalization of each gene across all samples.

Both parameters can accept the same arguments (detailed below), and both are
turned on by default.

.. _usage_norm_methods:

Normalization methods
---------------------

.. _usage_norm_center:

Centering
^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abagen.get_expression_data(atlas['image'], {sample,gene}_norm='center')

Microarray values are centered with:

.. math::

    x_{norm} = x_{y} - \bar{x}

where :math:`\bar{x}` is the mean of the microarray expression values.

.. _usage_norm_zscore:

Z-score
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abagen.get_expression_data(atlas['image'], {sample,gene}_norm='zscore')

Microarray values are normalized using a basic z-score function:

.. math::

    x_{norm} = \frac{x_{y} - \bar{x}}
                    {\sigma_{x}}

where :math:`\bar{x}` is the mean and :math:`\sigma_{x}` is the sample standard
deviation of the microarray expression values.

.. _usage_norm_minmax:

Min-max
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abagen.get_expression_data(atlas['image'], {sample,gene}_norm='minmax')

Microarray values are rescaled to the unit interval with:

.. math::

   x_{norm} = \frac{x_{y} - \text{min}(x)}
                   {\text{max}(x) - \text{min}(x)}


.. _usage_norm_sig:

Sigmoid
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abagen.get_expression_data(atlas['image'], {sample,gene}_norm='sigmoid')

Microarray values are normalized using a general sigmoid function:

.. math::

   x_{y} = \frac{1}
                {1 + \exp \left( \frac{-(x_{y} - \bar{x})}
                                      {\sigma_{x}}
                          \right)}

where :math:`\bar{x}` is the mean and :math:`\sigma_{x}` is the sample standard
deviation of the microarray expression values.

.. _usage_norm_scaledsig:

Scaled sigmoid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abagen.get_expression_data(atlas['image'], {sample,gene}_norm='scaled_sigmoid')

Microarray values are processed with the :ref:`sigmoid <usage_norm_sig>`
function and then rescaled to the unit interval with the :ref:`min-max
<usage_norm_minmax>` function.

.. _usage_norm_scaledsig_qnt:

Scaled sigmoid quantiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abagen.get_expression_data(atlas['image'], {sample,gene}_norm='scaled_sigmoid_quantiles')

Input data are clipped to the 5th and 95th percentiles before being processed
with the :ref:`scaled sigmoid <usage_norm_scaledsig>` transform. The clipped
distribution is only used for calculation of :math:`\bar{x}` and
:math:`\sigma_{x}`; the full (i.e., unclipped) distribution is processed
through the transformation.

.. _usage_norm_rs:

Robust sigmoid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abagen.get_expression_data(atlas['image'], {sample,gene}_norm='robust_sigmoid')

Microarray values are normalized using a robust sigmoid function:

.. math::

   x_{y} = \frac{1}
                {1 + \exp \left( \frac{-(x_{y} - \langle x \rangle)}
                                      {\text{IQR}_{x}}
                          \right)}

where :math:`\langle x \rangle` is the median and :math:`\text{IQR}_{x}` is the
normalized interquartile range of the microarray expression values given as:

.. math::

   \DeclareMathOperator\erf{erf}
   \text{IQR}_{x} = \frac{Q_{3} - Q{1}}
                         {2 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \erf^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}
            \approx \frac{Q_{3} - Q_{1}}
                         {1.35}

.. _usage_norm_srs:

Scaled robust sigmoid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abagen.get_expression_data(atlas['image'], {sample,gene}_norm='scaled_robust_sigmoid')

Microarray values are processed with the :ref:`robust sigmoid <usage_norm_rs>`
function and then rescaled to the unit interval with the :ref:`min-max
<usage_norm_minmax>` function.

.. _usage_norm_mixedsig:

Mixed sigmoid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abagen.get_expression_data(atlas['image'], {sample,gene}_norm='mixed_sigmoid')

Microarray values are processed with the :ref:`scaled sigmoid
<usage_norm_scaledsig>` function when their interquartile range is 0;
otherwise, they are processed with the :ref:`scaled robust sigmoid
<usage_norm_srs>` function.

.. _usage_norm_none:

No normalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abagen.get_expression_data(atlas['image'], {sample,gene}_norm=None)

Providing ``None`` to the ``sample_norm`` and ``gene_norm`` parameters will
prevent any normalization procedure from being performed on the data. Use this
with caution!

  :ref:`mixed sigmoid <usage_norm_mixedsig>`

.. _usage_norm_matched:

Normalizing only matched samples
--------------------------------

While sample normalization is _always_ performed across all genes, you can
control which samples are used when performing gene normalization. By default,
only those samples matched to regions in the provided atlas are used in the
normalization process (controllable via the ``norm_matched`` parameter):

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abagen.get_expression_data(atlas['image'], norm_matched=True)

However, when a smaller atlas is provided with only a few regions, normalizing
over just those samples matched to the atlas can be less desirable. To make it
so that all available samples are used instead of only those matched, set
``norm_matched`` to ``False``:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abagen.get_expression_data(atlas['image'], norm_matched=False)

.. warning::

    Given the preponderence of parameters in :func:`abagen.get_expression_data`
    it is perhaps unsurprising that they will interact with one another.
    However, it is worth pointing out that ``norm_matched`` will interact with
    the ``missing`` parameter in a relatively surprising manner (hence why we
    feel the need to make this note). This is due to the order in which
    sample-to-region matching, normalization, and "missing" regions are
    handled: when ``norm_matched`` is set to ``True`` all samples not matched
    to regions are removed prior to normalization. As such, if the ``missing``
    parameter is set, the program is only able to fill in missing regions with
    samples that had already been assigned to other regions. If, instead,
    ``norm_matched=False`` and the ``missing`` parameter is set, the program
    can use the full range of samples to fill in missing regions. For this
    reason, we suggest using ``norm_matched=False`` when also setting the
    ``missing`` parameter; however, we do not impose a restriction on this.

.. _usage_norm_structures:

Normalizing within structural classes
-------------------------------------

There are known differences in microarray expression between broad structural
designations (e.g. cortex, subcortex/brainstem, cerebellum). As such, it may
occasionally be desirable to constrain normalization such that the procedure is
performed separately for each structural designation. This process can be
controlled via the ``norm_structures`` parameter:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abagen.get_expression_data(atlas['image'], norm_structures=True)

By default, this parameter is set to ``False`` and normalization uses all
available samples. Note that changing this parameter will _dramatically_ modify
the returned expression information, so use with caution. For obvious reasons
this parameter will interact heavily with the ``norm_matched`` parameter
described above.
