User guide
----------

``abagen`` aims to provide a reproducible pipeline for processing and preparing
microarray expression data provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) for
research analyses.

This user guide steps through the basics of fetching microarray expression data
from the AHBA, defining an atlas or parcellation for wrangling that data, and
actually parcellating the data into a more usable, analyis-ready format. If you
still have questions after going through this guide you can refer to the
:ref:`api_ref` or ask a question on `GitHub <https://github.com/rmarkello/
abagen/issues>`_.
